<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
I hold an Engineering degree from the Ecole Centrale in Paris and combine a strong background in Mathematics
with 25 years of experience working on diversified software and data projects.
In the first period of my career, I mostly worked on C++ projects, some of which required algorithmic design.
In the second period, I mostly worked on Data projects. Now is an exciting time, as the shift to functional programming
and queries mean that Mathematics and Software/Data Engineering are converging more than ever before.
For Santarelli Group, after the acquisition of two companies, I successfully migrated their Patent data to an in house
system and merged all their patent data into one single on premise database, helping them cut cloud subscription and
data management cost by several hundred K.
My C++ Skills are as up to date as my SQL, because I maintain an online tool mostly written in Modern C++, which uses
advanced algorithms implemented in C++ and published in Web Assembly that allows me to quickly draw a map of a complex data
structure to gain insight that might otherwise have required several weeks.
It would be an exciting time for me to go back to C++, but I am also interested by complex data engineering projects
and web technologies.
